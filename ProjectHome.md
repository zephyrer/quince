**This project aims at building 2D/3D CAD system**
**This project use the fundamental tools:**
> C++ programming language and its libraries stl, boost

> MFC/Qt GUI framework, build with Visual Studio 2005/2008

> OpenGL graphics API and GLSL


**This project will be implemented:**
> With object oriented design & programming method in mind

> Apply design pattern everywhere to make the design more flexible, modular, reusable, and understandable

> Learn from existing libraries such as: Qt, Coin3D(Open Inventor), IrrLicht? & OGRE


**This project may interest people:**
> Who are beginning to learn OpenGL, specifically those part of modern features added in recent years, such as VBO, VAO, PBO and shader usage

> Who are interested in building the GUI system

> Who get to know design patterns but has difficulties to apply it in the programming practice to develop complex software

> Who want to know the application of spline curves or spline surfaces


**This project currently are in the build, most work was with 2D sketch**
